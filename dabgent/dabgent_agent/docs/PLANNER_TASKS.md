# Dabgent Planner Tasks (MVP)

## ✅ MVP Complete

### What We Built
- [x] Event-sourced planner with Handler trait
- [x] LLM integration for parsing natural language into tasks
- [x] DabGent MQ event persistence  
- [x] Minimal runner (81 lines)
- [x] Integration with existing Worker
- [x] Tests (6 passing)
- [x] Examples (planning.rs)

### Code Optimization Done
- [x] Removed feature flags - always available
- [x] Removed CLI module (saved 97 lines)
- [x] Deduplicated LLM calls (saved 12 lines)
- [x] Extracted tests to separate files (saved 261 lines)
- [x] Removed attachments feature (simplified)
- [x] Removed context compaction (saved ~100 lines)
- [x] Removed dependency analysis (saved ~80 lines)
- [x] Removed token budget management (saved ~20 lines)
- [x] Consolidated documentation

## 📊 Final Metrics

| Component | Lines | 
|-----------|-------|
| handler.rs | 379 |
| types.rs | 228 |
| llm.rs | 208 |
| runner.rs | 80 |
| mod.rs | 27 |

```bash
# Run example
cargo run --example planning

# In your code
planner::runner::run(llm, store, preamble, tools, input).await?
```

## ✅ Definition of Done

- [x] Parse natural language into tasks
- [x] Save/load events from store
- [x] Rebuild state from events
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Example working
- [x] Documentation complete

## 🎯 What's NOT in MVP (Intentionally)

These are future considerations, not current scope:

- Task dependency analysis
- Parallel execution
- Context compaction
- Multi-agent coordination
- Advanced error recovery
- Metrics and monitoring
- UI/visualization
- Performance optimization

## 📝 Summary

The MVP is **complete and working**:
- Takes natural language input
- Parses it into tasks using LLM
- Saves events to database
- Worker can execute tasks
- Simple, clean, tested

**Status: Ready to Ship** 🚀
