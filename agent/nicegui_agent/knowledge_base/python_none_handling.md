# None Handling Best Practices

Always handle None cases explicitly when dealing with Optional types. Check if value is None before using it, especially for query results and optional attributes. Use early returns for None checks to reduce nesting and improve code readability.

Implement defensive programming by validating query results before processing: `user = session.get(User, user_id); if user is None: return None`. For optional attributes, guard access with explicit None checks: `if item.id is not None: process(item.id)`. This prevents runtime errors and makes your code more robust.

For chained optional access, check each level separately: `if user and user.profile and user.profile.settings:` rather than assuming the entire chain exists. This pattern prevents AttributeError exceptions and makes your code more predictable when dealing with complex object hierarchies.
