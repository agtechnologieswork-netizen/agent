# Professional Layout Patterns

Implement card-based dashboards with consistent spacing and visual hierarchy. Create reusable metric cards with proper padding, shadows, and hover effects: `ui.card().classes('p-6 bg-white shadow-lg rounded-xl hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow')`. Use semantic color classes and consistent typography scales for professional appearance.

Build responsive sidebar layouts using flexbox patterns: sidebar with fixed width (`w-64`) and main content area with `flex-1`. Apply appropriate background colors (`bg-gray-800` for sidebar, `bg-gray-50` for content) and ensure proper text contrast. Include hover states for navigation items.

Design modern forms with proper spacing between elements, clear labels, and organized action buttons. Use card containers (`w-96 p-6 shadow-lg rounded-lg`) for forms, consistent margin spacing (`mb-4`), and logical button grouping with `ui.row().classes('gap-2 justify-end')` for actions.
