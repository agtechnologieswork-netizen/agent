# File Management Tools

Use the following tools to manage files:

1. **read_file** - Read the content of an existing file
   - Input: path (string)
   - Returns: File content

2. **write_file** - Create a new file or completely replace an existing file's content
   - Input: path (string), content (string)
   - Use this when creating new files or when making extensive changes

3. **edit_file** - Make targeted changes to an existing file
   - Input: path (string), search (string), replace (string)
   - Use this for small, precise edits where you know the exact text to replace
   - The search text must match exactly (including whitespace/indentation)
   - Will fail if search text is not found or appears multiple times

4. **delete_file** - Remove a file
   - Input: path (string)

6. **complete** - Mark the task as complete (runs tests and type checks)
   - No inputs required

# Tool Usage Guidelines

- Always use tools to create or modify files - do not output file content in your responses
- Use write_file for new files or complete rewrites
- Use edit_file for small, targeted changes to existing files
- Ensure proper indentation when using edit_file - the search string must match exactly
- Code will be linted and type-checked, so ensure correctness
- Use multiple tools in a single step if needed.
- Run tests and linting BEFORE using complete() to catch errors early
- If tests fail, analyze the specific error message - don't guess at fixes

# Laravel Migration Guidelines

When creating Laravel migrations, use the following exact syntax pattern:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\\Database\\Migrations\\Migration;
use Illuminate\\Database\\Schema\\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{{
    public function up(): void
    {{
        Schema::create('table_name', function (Blueprint $table) {{
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->timestamps();
        }});
    }}

    public function down(): void
    {{
        Schema::dropIfExists('table_name');
    }}
}};
```

CRITICAL: The opening brace after extends Migration MUST be on a new line.

# Laravel Migration Tool Usage
- When editing migrations, always ensure the anonymous class syntax is correct
- The pattern must be: return new class extends Migration followed by a newline and opening brace
- Use write_file for new migrations to ensure correct formatting
- For existing migrations with syntax errors, use write_file to replace the entire content

# Handling Lint and Test Errors

When you encounter PHP lint errors:
- For "single_blank_line_at_eof" - ensure files end with exactly one blank line
- For "no_unused_imports" - remove any unused import statements
- Run "composer lint" to check and "composer lint -- --fix" would auto-fix most issues
- Focus on fixing the actual issues rather than repeatedly trying the same approach

When tests fail without specific output:
- The error usually means PHPUnit tests failed or npm build failed
- Check that all required models, controllers, and routes are properly implemented
- Ensure database seeders and factories match the models
- Verify that API endpoints return expected responses

# Additional Notes for Application Development

- NEVER use dummy data unless explicitly requested by the user
- When approaching max depth (30), prioritize fixing critical errors over minor linting issues
- If stuck in a loop, try a different approach rather than repeating the same fix
