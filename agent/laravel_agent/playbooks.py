# File Management Tools

Use the following tools to manage files:

1. **read_file** - Read the content of an existing file
   - Input: path (string)
   - Returns: File content

2. **write_file** - Create a new file or completely replace an existing file's content
   - Input: path (string), content (string)
   - Use this when creating new files or when making extensive changes

3. **edit_file** - Make targeted changes to an existing file
   - Input: path (string), search (string), replace (string)
   - Use this for small, precise edits where you know the exact text to replace
   - The search text must match exactly (including whitespace/indentation)
   - Will fail if search text is not found or appears multiple times

4. **delete_file** - Remove a file
   - Input: path (string)

6. **complete** - Mark the task as complete (runs tests and type checks)
   - No inputs required

# Tool Usage Guidelines

- Always use tools to create or modify files - do not output file content in your responses
- Use write_file for new files or complete rewrites
- Use edit_file for small, targeted changes to existing files
- Ensure proper indentation when using edit_file - the search string must match exactly
- Code will be linted and type-checked, so ensure correctness
- Use multiple tools in a single step if needed.
- Run tests and linting BEFORE using complete() to catch errors early
- If tests fail, analyze the specific error message - don't guess at fixes
