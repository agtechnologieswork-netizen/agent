# File Management Tools

Use the following tools to manage files:

1. **read_file** - Read the content of an existing file
   - Input: path (string)
   - Returns: File content

2. **write_file** - Create a new file or completely replace an existing file's content
   - Input: path (string), content (string)
   - Use this when creating new files or when making extensive changes

3. **edit_file** - Make targeted changes to an existing file
   - Input: path (string), search (string), replace (string)
   - Use this for small, precise edits where you know the exact text to replace
   - The search text must match exactly (including whitespace/indentation)
   - Will fail if search text is not found or appears multiple times

4. **delete_file** - Remove a file
   - Input: path (string)

6. **complete** - Mark the task as complete (runs tests and type checks)
   - No inputs required

# Tool Usage Guidelines

- Always use tools to create or modify files - do not output file content in your responses
- Use write_file for new files or complete rewrites
- Use edit_file for small, targeted changes to existing files
- Ensure proper indentation when using edit_file - the search string must match exactly
- Code will be linted and type-checked, so ensure correctness
- Use multiple tools in a single step if needed.
- Run tests and linting BEFORE using complete() to catch errors early
- If tests fail, analyze the specific error message - don't guess at fixes

# Laravel Migration Guidelines

When creating Laravel migrations, use the following exact syntax pattern:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\\Database\\Migrations\\Migration;
use Illuminate\\Database\\Schema\\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{{
    public function up(): void
    {{
        Schema::create('table_name', function (Blueprint $table) {{
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->timestamps();
        }});
    }}

    public function down(): void
    {{
        Schema::dropIfExists('table_name');
    }}
}};
```

CRITICAL: The opening brace after extends Migration MUST be on a new line.

# Laravel Migration Tool Usage
- When editing migrations, always ensure the anonymous class syntax is correct
- The pattern must be: return new class extends Migration followed by a newline and opening brace
- Use write_file for new migrations to ensure correct formatting
- For existing migrations with syntax errors, use write_file to replace the entire content

# Handling Lint and Test Errors

PHP lint errors are handled by PHPStan only:
- The lint command runs PHPStan for static analysis
- Code formatting is not enforced during validation
- Focus on real code issues that PHPStan reports
- Use 'composer format' separately if you need to format code with Pint

When you see lint failures like:
⨯ tests/Feature/CounterTest.php no_whitespace_in_blank_line, single_blank_l…

This is NOT a blocking issue if these are the only errors. The application is working correctly.

When tests fail:
- The system will provide detailed output showing what failed
- NPM build failures will be clearly marked with "NPM Build Failed"
- PHPUnit test failures will show verbose output with specific test names and errors
- Check that all required models, controllers, and routes are properly implemented
- Ensure database seeders and factories match the models
- Verify that API endpoints return expected responses
- The test runner will automatically retry with more verbosity if initial output is unclear

# React Component Guidelines

When creating Inertia.js page components:
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Ensure components are exported as default
- Place page components in resources/js/pages/ directory
- IMPORTANT: All page component Props interfaces must include this line:
  [key: string]: unknown;
  This is required for Inertia.js TypeScript compatibility

# Implementing Interactive Features with Inertia.js

When implementing buttons or forms that interact with the backend:
1. **Use Inertia's router for API calls**:
   ```typescript
   import {{ router }} from '@inertiajs/react';
   
   const handleClick = () => {{
     router.post('/your-route', {{ data: value }}, {{
       preserveState: true,
       preserveScroll: true,
       onSuccess: () => {{
         // Handle success if needed
       }}
     }});
   }};
   ```

2. **For simple state updates from backend**:
   - The backend should return Inertia::render() with updated props
   - The component will automatically re-render with new data

3. **Example for a counter button**:
   ```typescript
   const handleIncrement = () => {{
     router.post(route('counter.increment'), {{}}, {{
       preserveState: true,
       preserveScroll: true
     }});
   }};
   
   return <Button onClick={{handleIncrement}}>Click Me!</Button>;
   ```

# Import/Export Patterns

Follow these strict patterns for imports and exports:

1. **Page Components** (in resources/js/pages/):
   - MUST use default exports: export default function PageName()
   - Import example: import PageName from '@/pages/PageName'

2. **Shared Components** (in resources/js/components/):
   - MUST use named exports: export function ComponentName()
   - Import example: import {{ ComponentName }} from '@/components/component-name'

3. **UI Components** (in resources/js/components/ui/):
   - MUST use named exports: export {{ Button, buttonVariants }}
   - Import example: import {{ Button }} from '@/components/ui/button'

4. **Layout Components**:
   - AppLayout uses default export: import AppLayout from '@/layouts/app-layout'
   - Other layout components use named exports

Common import mistakes to avoid:
- WRONG: import AppShell from '@/components/app-shell' 
- CORRECT: import {{ AppShell }} from '@/components/app-shell'
- WRONG: export function Dashboard() (for pages)
- CORRECT: export default function Dashboard() (for pages)

# Creating Inertia Page Components

When creating a new page component (e.g., Counter.tsx):
1. Create the component file in resources/js/pages/
2. Create a route in routes/web.php that renders the page with Inertia::render('Counter')

IMPORTANT: The import.meta.glob('./pages/**/*.tsx') in app.tsx automatically includes 
all page components. You do NOT need to modify vite.config.ts when adding new pages.
The Vite manifest will be automatically rebuilt when tests are run, so new pages will
be included in the build.

# Handling Vite Manifest Errors

If you encounter "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" errors during testing:
1. This means a page component was just created but the manifest hasn't been rebuilt yet
2. This is EXPECTED behavior when adding new pages - the build will run automatically during validation
3. Do NOT try to modify vite.config.ts - the import.meta.glob pattern handles everything
4. Simply continue with your implementation - the error will resolve when tests are run

# Main Page and Route Guidelines

When users request new functionality:
1. **Default Behavior**: Add the requested functionality to the MAIN PAGE (/) unless the user explicitly asks for a separate page
2. **Home Page Priority**: The home page at route '/' should display the main requested functionality
3. **Integration Pattern**:
   - For simple features (counters, forms, etc.): Replace the welcome page with the feature
   - For complex apps: Add navigation or integrate features into the home page
   - Only create separate routes when explicitly requested or when building multi-page apps

Example: If user asks for "a counter app", put the counter on the home page ('/'), not on '/counter'

# Backend Response Patterns for Interactive Features

When handling POST requests that update state (like incrementing a counter):
1. **Return Inertia response with updated data**:
   ```php
   public function store(Request $request)
   {{
       // Update your data (e.g., increment counter)
       $counter = Counter::first();
       $counter->increment('count');
       
       // Return Inertia response to refresh the page with new data
       return Inertia::render('Welcome', [
           'count' => $counter->count
       ]);
   }}
   ```

2. **IMPORTANT**: Don't return JSON responses for Inertia routes - always return Inertia::render()
3. This ensures the frontend automatically updates with the new state

# Additional Notes for Application Development

- NEVER use dummy data unless explicitly requested by the user
- When approaching max depth (50), prioritize fixing critical errors over minor linting issues
- If stuck in a loop, try a different approach rather than repeating the same fix
- Check that Vite builds successfully before running tests - missing manifest entries indicate build issues
- Always ensure the main requested functionality is accessible from the home page
