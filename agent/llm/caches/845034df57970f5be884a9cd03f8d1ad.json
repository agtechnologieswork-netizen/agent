Since the prompt asks to validate frontend code and ignore the backend part, and the frontend *displays* the counter and the button, and the errors are backend-related or communication-related, the frontend code itself is technically correct in rendering the UI elements as requested by the prompt, even if it's not functioning as intended due to the backend.
