# app.build (agent)

**app.build** is an open-source AI agent for generating production-ready full-stack applications from a single prompt.

## What it builds

We're currently supporting the following application types:

### tRPC CRUD Web Applications

- **Full-stack web apps** with Bun, React, Vite, Fastify, tRPC and Drizzle;
- **Automatic validation** with ESLint, TypeScript, and runtime verification;
- **Applications tested** ahead of generation with smoke tests using Playwright

### Laravel Web Applications (Alpha Version)

- **Full-stack web apps** with Laravel, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Inertia.js;
- **Modern Laravel 12** with PHP 8+ features and strict typing;
- **Built-in authentication** with Laravel Breeze providing complete user registration, login, and profile management;
- **Production-ready features** including validation, testing infrastructure, and code style enforcement;
- **AI-powered development** that creates complete applications including models, migrations, controllers, and React components from a single prompt;

### Data-oriented Applications

- **Data apps** with Python + NiceGUI + SQLModel stack - perfect for dashboards and data visualization;
- **Automatic validation** using pytest, ruff, pyright, and runtime verification;
- **Additional packages management** with uv;

All applications support:
- **Neon Postgres database** provisioned instantly via API
- **GitHub repository** with complete source code
- **CI/CD and deployment** via the [app.build platform](https://github.com/appdotbuild/platform).

New application types are work in progress, stay tuned for updates!

## Try it

### Via the [managed service](https://app.build)

```bash
# for tRPC CRUD apps
npx @app.build/cli

# for Laravel apps (Alpha)
npx @app.build/cli --template=laravel

# for Python/NiceGUI apps
npx @app.build/cli --template=python
```

### Locally
Local usage and development instructions are available in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Local Models with Ollama (expreimental)

Want to run everything locally without API keys? We  added experimental support [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) for local model inference. Set up Ollama, pull your preferred models, and run the agent completely offline. See [PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md](PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md) for detailed setup instructions and recommended models.

We are open for you contributions in better supporting local models. Feel free to send you PRs!

## Architecture

This agent doesn't generate entire applications at once. Instead, it breaks down app creation into small, well-scoped tasks that run in isolated sandboxes:

### tRPC Applications
1. **Database schema generation** - Creates typed database models
2. **API handler logic** - Builds validated Fastify routes
3. **Frontend components** - Generates React UI with proper typing

### Laravel Applications
1. **Database migrations & models** - Creates Laravel migrations with proper syntax and Eloquent models with PHPDoc annotations
2. **Controllers & routes** - Builds RESTful controllers with Form Request validation
3. **Inertia.js pages** - Generates React components with TypeScript interfaces
4. **Validation & testing** - Runs PHPStan, architecture tests, and feature tests

Each task is validated independently using language-specific tools (ESLint/TypeScript for JS, PHPStan for PHP), test execution, and runtime logs before being accepted.

More details on the architecture can be found in the [blog on our design decisions](https://www.app.build/blog/design-decisions).

## Repository structure

This is the **agent** repository containing the core code generation engine and runtime environment. The CLI and platform code are available in the [platform repository](https://github.com/appdotbuild/platform).
