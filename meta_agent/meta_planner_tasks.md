  - Handler trait with process/fold
  - Command/Event types
  - State management
  - Comprehensive tests

### üöß Active Development (This Week)
**DabGent MQ Integration - The Foundation**
1. Add dabgent_mq dependency ‚Üê START HERE
2. Implement Event trait for our events
3. Create PlannerStore adapter
4. Update examples with real persistence
5. Verify with integration tests

### üìÖ Next Sprint
- Event streaming architecture
- Subscription-based executor routing
- Basic LLM integration for planning

## Key Design Benefits

### Handler Trait Pattern
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic isolated from infrastructure
- **Testability**: Easy to test without mocking infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Works with any messaging/storage backend
- **Event Sourcing**: Full audit trail and state reconstruction via fold()

### Clean Architecture
```
Commands ‚Üí Handler.process() ‚Üí Events
             ‚Üì
        State Update
             ‚Üì
     Infrastructure Layer
```

## Usage Examples

### Direct Usage
```rust
let mut planner = Planner::new();
let events = planner.process(command)?;
```

### With Event Sourcing
```rust
let planner = Planner::fold(&historical_events);
let events = planner.process(Command::Continue)?;
```

### Async Integration
```rust
async fn handle(planner: Arc<Mutex<Planner>>, cmd: Command) {
    let events = planner.lock().await.process(cmd)?;
    for event in events {
        bus.publish(event).await;
    }
}
```

## Implementation Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Start Simple, Think Big**: MVP today, platform tomorrow
2. **DabGent MQ First**: Use production infrastructure from day one
3. **Event-Driven Everything**: All state changes via events
4. **Clean Architecture**: Handler pattern keeps logic pure
5. **Test with Real Systems**: No mocks, use actual databases

### Technical Strategy
- **Leverage DabGent MQ**: Don't rebuild event sourcing
- **Handler Pattern**: Separate business logic from infrastructure
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Each phase builds on the last
- **Production-First**: Use real databases even in tests
- **Observable by Design**: Correlation IDs from the start

### Development Workflow
1. Write integration test first (with DabGent MQ)
2. Implement minimal handler logic
3. Add event persistence
4. Enable subscriptions
5. Verify with replay test

## The Journey Ahead

We're not just building a planner - we're creating the foundation for an AI-native development platform. Every line of code we write today is a step toward a future where AI agents collaborate seamlessly to build software.

**Today**: Handler + Events
**Tomorrow**: Intelligent orchestration
**The Dream**: Self-improving AI development ecosystem

DabGent MQ gives us the infrastructure. The Handler pattern gives us the architecture. Together, they give us the path to our grand vision.

üöÄ **Let's build the future!**
