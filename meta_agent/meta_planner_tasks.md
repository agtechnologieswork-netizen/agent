### üöß Next Steps (Revised with DabGent MQ)
1. **DabGent MQ Integration** - Replace our minimal traits with production infrastructure
2. **Real-time Event Streaming** - Leverage subscription capabilities for reactive architecture
3. **LLM Enhancement** - Replace simple parser with LLM-based planning
4. **Advanced Features** - Add sophisticated event processing patterns

## Key Design Benefits

### Handler Trait Pattern
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic isolated from infrastructure
- **Testability**: Easy to test without mocking infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Works with any messaging/storage backend
- **Event Sourcing**: Full audit trail and state reconstruction via fold()

### Clean Architecture
```
Commands ‚Üí Handler.process() ‚Üí Events
             ‚Üì
        State Update
             ‚Üì
     Infrastructure Layer
```

## Usage Examples

### Direct Usage
```rust
let mut planner = Planner::new();
let events = planner.process(command)?;
```

### With Event Sourcing
```rust
let planner = Planner::fold(&historical_events);
let events = planner.process(Command::Continue)?;
```

### Async Integration
```rust
async fn handle(planner: Arc<Mutex<Planner>>, cmd: Command) {
    let events = planner.lock().await.process(cmd)?;
    for event in events {
        bus.publish(event).await;
    }
}
```

## Dependencies & Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (1.70+) 
- **DabGent MQ**: Full event sourcing and messaging system (already merged!)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for production event storage
- Existing meta_agent codebase

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Leverage existing infrastructure** - Don't rebuild what DabGent MQ already provides
- Maintain clean separation between business logic and infrastructure via Handler trait
- Write tests alongside implementation, using production infrastructure in tests
- Use DabGent MQ as the integration boundary for all persistence and messaging
- Focus on planner domain logic; let DabGent MQ handle event sourcing infrastructure
