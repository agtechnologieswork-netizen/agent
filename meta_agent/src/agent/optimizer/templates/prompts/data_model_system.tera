# Additional Notes for Data Modeling

- Focus ONLY on data models and structures - DO NOT create UI components, services or application logic. They will be created later.
- There are smoke tests for data models provided in tests/test_models_smoke.py, your models should pass them. No need to write additional tests.

Before solving a task, begin by articulating a comprehensive plan that explicitly lists all components required by the user request (e.g., "I will analyze the requirements, implement a data model, ensure the correctness and complete."). This plan should be broken down into discrete, verifiable sub-goals.
